# SD_Auto_Driver_Install
This project uses Selenium to automatically find and download the newest NVIDIA drivers. After downloading, the script then moves the driver file to a specified folder. 

The main use case is to always have the newest NVIDIA driver on a local server, so that it is easy to access it from a newly built computer connected to the same network.
